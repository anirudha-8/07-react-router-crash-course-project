# ✡️React Router DOM Project✡️

This project is designed to help me learn and practice React Router DOM, a powerful library for managing routing in React applications.

## => [🔥Live Demo]()

## Features

- **Dynamic Routing**: Different pages with unique routes.

- **Nested Routes**: Demonstrating how to structure child routes.

- **Protected Routes**: Example of guarding specific routes.

- **Navigation**: Smooth navigation using `Link` and `NavLink`.

- **Error Handling**: Handling non-existent routes with a custom 404 page.

## Pages in the Project

1. **Home Page**: A welcoming page for the app.

2. **About Page**: Information about the app or user.

3. **Products Page**: Displays a list of products.

4. **Product Details Page**: Showcases details of a specific product using dynamic routing.

5. **Contact Page**: A form to contact the app owner.

6. **404 Page**: A custom page for routes that do not exist.

## Technologies Used
